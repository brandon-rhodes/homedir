# Since I use the `~/Downloads` directory as a general-purpose 'stack'
# (sorted by date) for moving files, I very often type `ltr ~/Downloads`
# to view it as a stack - but the huge resulting listing then nukes my
# terminal history; I'm usually too impatient to type `| tail` to limit
# the output.  So let's wrap the whole maneuver up as a script, and make
# the output especially pretty to encourage me to remember and use it!

ls -ort --block-size="'1" --time-style='+ %Y-%m-%d %H:%M ' ~/Downloads \
    | sed 's/-rw-rw-r--  1 brandon//' \
    | tail -5
