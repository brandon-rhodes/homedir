# Why launch an Emacs server, when it starts up so fast these days?
# Because this script is set as my 'git commit' editor, and here is my
# almost invariable workflow:
#
# 1. I run `git ci`.
# 2. I painstakingly craft a commit message with a â‰¤50 char summary.
# 3. I glance at the diff, and see that I left in a debug statement!
# 4. So I delete the message and exit, so git will abort the commit.
# 5. I remove the debug statement.
# 6. I re-run `git ci`.
# 7. I need the commit message back!
#
# Step 7 is an unhappy one if I exited Emacs without backing up the
# commit message somewhere, because then I need to recreate it.  But if
# I use the Emacs daemon, then it's waiting in the kill ring for me!
