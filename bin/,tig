# Launch ‘tig’ in its own xterm, which is configured with a smaller font
# size (and thus more history on display) than my alacritty terminal
# windows.  I call this with an Emacs keystroke to jump into 'blame',
# and from the command line to view logs without overwriting the shell's
# terminal window.
