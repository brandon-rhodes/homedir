Connected the Heathkit H19 to a Linux box, since it lives on my desk
now, and it still works!  So that I don’t forget: never try to test a
serial device with `cat` because it doesn’t set up DTR and the device
will never send or receive.  For a quick conversation:

cu -d -E '+' -e -o --nostop -l /dev/ttyS0 -s 9600 dir

And for a prompt:

getty -8 -h -L ttyS0 9600 h19

~/usr/lib/garmin/fit2tcx < ~/dropbox/Garmin/91BA0931.FIT > ~/tmp.tcx

Figured out that Garmin uses the distance field, while Runkeeper ignores
it and re-computes the distance between the 50m waypoints using the
latitudes and longitudes, and assuming you took a straight line between
them.

======== 2019 January 24 Thursday ========

After upgrading to Ubuntu 18.10, can’t adjust the backlight brightness
on my X260 with xbacklight.  Instead:

echo 120 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness

======== 2019 January 15 Tuesday ========

Wanted Google Earth to start working again on my Thinkpad X260 so apt
uninstalled “xserver-xorg-video-intel” as recommended here:

https://askubuntu.com/questions/965853/google-earth-doesnt-show-map

Rebooted, and it worked!

======== 2018 July 07 Saturday ========

To run the prism.js tests for Python only:

./node_modules/.bin/mocha tests --grep python

	'comment': {
		pattern: /(^[^'"]*(?:"(?:[^"]|\\")*"[^"']*|'(?:[^']|\\')*'[^"']*)*)#.*/,
		lookbehind: true
	},

(?:"(?:[^"]|\\")*"[^"']*|'(?:[^']|\\')*'[^"']*)*

To speed up my trackpoint that was hurting my hand by the force it required:

odell# echo 255 > /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/speed
odell# echo 255 > /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/sensitivity

Original values were 97 and 200, despite:

/etc/udev/rules.d/trackpoint.rules:SUBSYSTEM=="serio", DRIVERS=="psmouse", DEVPATH="/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2", ATTR{sensitivity}="255", ATTR{speed}="255"

======== 2018 June 21 Thursday ========

To list keyframes in a video:

$ ffprobe -select_streams v -show_frames \
-show_entries frame=pict_type \
-of csv download.mp4 \
| grep -n I | cut -d ':' -f 1

======== 2018 March 30 Friday ========

Which feeds should I bother generating for my blog?  Tallying the most
recent log file:

      1 /brandon/category/zope/feed/index.xml
      1 /brandon/feed/atom
      9 /brandon/category/python/feed
     10 /brandon/category/python/feed/index.xml
     12 /brandon/feed/atom/
     32 /brandon/category/python/feed/
    261 /brandon/feed
    482 /brandon/feed/

Eliminating duplicates, these are the keepers:

 /brandon/category/python/feed/
 /brandon/category/python/feed/index.xml
 /brandon/category/zope/feed/index.xml
 /brandon/feed/
 /brandon/feed/atom/

But the Zope feed had only one fetch, so I’m retiring it anyway.

======== 2018 January 01 Monday ========

Topo map for our Grand Canyon hike:

http://www.mytopo.com/review.cfm?mytopoid=18822625BD1

From ImageMagick “convert” on a large file got:

“cache resources exhausted”

So edited /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml to say:

  <policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="10GiB"/>

======== 2016 September 21 Wednesday ========

To turn the SVG of the logo into a square logo for social media:

convert pycon2017.svg -bordercolor white -border 0x165 pycon2017.png

And to create a rectangular version to use temporarily for the Facebook
cover photograph:

convert pycon2017.svg -bordercolor white -border 300x165 pycon2017.png

======== 2016 October 02 Sunday ========

To get volume buttons working on the X260:

apt install pulseaudio

And then had to start the daemon by hand and start xfce4-volumed and
restart Chrome.

======== 2016 November 15 Tuesday ========

To see how many PyCon proposals there were on each day of the CFP:

select submitted, row_number() OVER (order by submitted) from pycon_pycontutorialproposal ptp join proposals_proposalbase ppb on (ptp.proposalbase_ptr_id = ppb.id) order by submitted;

select submitted, row_number() OVER (order by submitted) from pycon_pycontalkproposal ptp join proposals_proposalbase ppb on (ptp.proposalbase_ptr_id = ppb.id) order by submitted;

======== 2017 January 19 Thursday ========

The "xbacklight" tool was giving an error trying to set the brightness
on my X260.  Creating an /etc/X11/xorg.conf like this fixed the problem:

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Card0"
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
EndSection

======== 2017 January 29 Sunday ========

My own fork of vagrant-lxc, that fixes the umask problem:
https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/vagrant-lxc

Installing the plugin from source is described here:
https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/Development

I also created `~/bin/vagrant` as a temporary fix.

======== 2017 February 06 Monday ========

Signed up for G Suite for rhodesmill.org and shut down "asaph" Linode.
First backed the machine up to S3 with:

tar cSf - --one-file-system / | ./s3cmd put - s3://rhodesmill/backup-asaph.tar

Then downloaded the file to one of my personal laptops, and also copied
it on to a thumb drive.

======== 2017 April 20 Thursday ========

After several suspends, my Lenovo Thinkpad X260 sometimes suffers
from flickering graphics and even freezes that show up in the kernel
logs as:

[199835.395375] drm/i915: Resetting chip after gpu hang
[199835.395533] [drm] GuC firmware load skipped
[199837.411851] [drm] RC6 on

So, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T460s and thus
I am adding i915.enable_rc6=0 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in
/etc/default/grub and then re-running: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

======== 2017 July 11 Tuesday ========

My Lenovo Thinkpad X260 wireless fails to reconnect to Wifi after I
suspend and resume, so I have added a script to explicitly stop and
start the network manager every time I suspend:

#!/bin/bash

exec >>/tmp/brandon-sleep.log 2>&1

date
echo /etc/pm/sleep.d/brandon invoked with: "$@"

case "$1" in
    "suspend" )
        service network-manager stop
        ;;
    "resume" )
        service network-manager start
        ;;
esac

echo

======== 2017 September 10 Sunday ========

Calculation of how far we went each day on our 2-day hike we just
completed of Wildcat Hollow:

Minutes hiked the first day: (- (+ (* 7 60) 10) (+ (* 3 60) 24)) 226
Minutes hiked the second day: (- (+ (* 14 60) 40) (+ (* 8 60) 50)) 350
Fraction of distance the first day: (* 14.7 (/ 226.0 (+ 226 350))) 5.8
Fraction of distance the second day: (* 14.7 (/ 350.0 (+ 226 350))) 8.9
