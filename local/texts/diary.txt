Hibernation now works on my old X1 Carbon, so I don’t lose state if I
leave it unplugged and it runs out of battery.  This helped:

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1355428/how-do-i-hibernate-in-ubuntu-20-04

I also set `CriticalPowerAction=Hibernate` in:
/etc/UPower/UPower.conf

and then ran:
systemctl restart upower

From my browser bookmarks, here’s the URL to view Google Photos by the

To take an old OGG file that recorded NTSC video at 720x480 with
rectangular pixels, and convert it to a 720x540 MP4 with modern square
pixels that will play back with a correct 4:3 aspect ratio, it turns out
that you need to mention the target resolution on the command line not
once but twice:

ffmpeg -i razzle.ogg -aspect 720:540 -vf scale=720:540 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p razzle-4-3.mp4

======== 2024 August 13 Tuesday ========

To extract the audio of an mp4 video:

ffmpeg -i ~/local/containers/ubuntu-24.04/Across\ the\ Great\ Divide.mp4 \

======== 2024 July 24 Wednesday ========

Downloading YouTube videos — for example, to back up copies of my old
conference talks in case the account that originally posted them goes
away — has become troublesome; the old `youtube-dl` tool, for example,
no longer seems to work, and no browser extension seems up to the task
either.  Happily, one tool remains:

https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

I run its single-file Python 3 application inside of a Docker container
for safety.  I first need to run:

apt update && apt install ffmpeg

Maybe my Docker container has antiquated SSL support, because I get
certificate errors, but I can get around them with:

./yt-dlp --no-check-certificates https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bZSCb644_M

======== 2024 April 21 Sunday ========

I have deleted a pair of old scripts that reminded me how to activate
the VGA output on my oldest laptop, so here are the crucial commands in
case I never need them again:

xrandr --output VGA --same-as LVDS --mode 1024x768 --rate 60.0
xrandr --output VGA --off

By comparison, the HDMI commands for my recent presentations look like:

xrandr --output HDMI-2 --same-as eDP-1 --mode 1280x720
xrandr --output HDMI-2 --off

======== 2024 February 17 Saturday ========

Here’s how I used the command line to find quote-tweets of an annual
Lord of the Rings tweet, using the `tweets.js` data from a Twitter
archive download — on the off chance that (a) I ever need it again and
(b) remember that I’ve done it before, which might be unlikely:

$ cat tweets.js| sed 's/window.YTD.tweets.part0 =//' | jq -r '.[].tweet | .id + " " + .full_text' |grep 'face of a standing-stone' | awk '{print "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShireReckoning/status/" $1 "/quotes\">link</a>"}' > ~/tmp.html

This was in search of an old reaction to a @ShireReckoning tweet.
Twitter’s search is now poor enough that I wasn’t able to find it using
their web interface.

======== 2024 January 30 Tuesday ========

To scan with our Brother DCP 8040, I had to download the driver here:

https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadhowto.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=dcp8040_all&os=128&dlid=dlf006893_000&flang=4&type3=625

Then I ran the driver install tool (as root, which was a very sketchy
thing to do, alas!) and had to answer ‘DCP8040’ for the model number,
without any whitespace inside.  Then I had to reboot before the
`simple-scan` tool would recognize it.

The output pages were not letter sized, so I created this small pypdf
script:

from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter
reader = PdfReader("example.pdf")
page = reader.pages[0]
writer = PdfWriter()
page.mediabox.lower_right = (
    8.5 * 72,
    page.mediabox.top - 11.0 * 72,
)
writer.add_page(page)
with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as fp:
    writer.write(fp)

======== 2024 January 21 Sunday ========

These commands let me test out my new ‘udev/rules.d/backlight.rules’

======== 2023 January 29 Sunday ========

How can I tell if the ports of my Mikrotik router are really running at
their top speed of 1000Mbps and not a lower speed like 100Mbps?  By
visting “/webfig/#Terminal”, running the command “interface ethernet
monitor” and giving the prompt “numbers:” something like “0,1,2”.

======== 2021 September 10 Friday ========

It’s now time to calibrate a second monitor and after two months I’ve
already forgotten how, so: the tool I originally used is DisplayCAL, but
this second time I’m happier using the lower-level tools described here:

======== 2021 September 02 Thursday ========

To snag a few pages from an old issue of Popular Science and turn them
into a PDF, first find the issue on Google Books, and use its hash with
the “pysheng” tool from GitHub:

$ pysheng TCEDAAAAMBAJ

Then figure out which of the resulting images compose the article, and:

$ convert 128.png 129.png 130.png 131.png \
  -units pixelsperinch -density 72 -page letter \
  ../bolometer.pdf

======== 2021 May 05 Wednesday ========

I always have to look up the options that tell `wget` to recursively
capture a whole web site.  It looks like the simplest approach is
something like:

======== 2020 September 22 Tuesday ========

To check my site for broken links, insisting on updating links that now

======== 2020 September 14 Monday ========

I finally found the problem that was causing this error every time I
started Emacs and opened a Python file:

File mode specification error: (wrong-type-argument lsp-session ...

The problem was a `./.emacs.d/.lsp-session-v1` file (which I did not
even know existed) which was apparently malformed.  I removed the file
and the error has gone away!

======== 2020 June 26 Friday ========

Since upgrading the Lenovo ThinkPad X260 to Ubuntu 20.04, Google Chrome
browser tabs that attempted aggressive graphics would crash.  A search
for the Arch Linux notes on the laptop led to:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Laptop/Lenovo#Thinkpad_X260
https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/gu0a8a/psa_solution_for_random_freezes_with_intel_igpu/

So I have added "i915.enable_psr=0" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
setting in /etc/default/grub and re-ran:

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

After rebooting, Chrome seems stable again!

======== 2019 October 12 Saturday ========

The Lenovo ThinkPad X260, it turns out, is rather fragile under Linux,
and does not like the fact that I upgraded to Ubuntu 19.04; it has
started freezing every few minutes for several seconds each time, unless
I boot into a < 4.16 kernel.  I guess I should have gotten a laptop
built on a more robust chipset, but my research at the time didn’t
suggest Linux would have problems.

None of the mitigations in this thread:

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105962

seem to work; freezing still persists.  So, a big decision: do I try
surviving 19.04 by pinning an older kernel?  Or reinstall 18.04 LTS and
endure old versions of software for the lifetime of the laptop?

It looks like some 4.15 images are included in 19.04:

https://packages.ubuntu.com/disco/kernel/

I am not sure why, but I'm trying 4.15.0-1056-oem and we'll see what
happens.  After a day, no freezes yet.  For the record, here are all of
the kernel options that did *not* work in getting a more recent kernel
stable on the X260:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash i915.enable_rc6=0 intel_idle.max_cstate=1 i915.enable_dc=0 i915.disable_power_well=0"

======== 2019 February 07 Thursday ========

Connected the Heathkit H19 to a Linux box, since it lives on my desk
now, and it still works!  So that I don’t forget: never try to test a
serial device with `cat` because it doesn’t set up DTR and the device
will never send or receive.  For a quick conversation:

cu -d -E '+' -e -o --nostop -l /dev/ttyS0 -s 9600 dir

And for a prompt:

getty -8 -h -L ttyS0 9600 h19

======== 2019 January 26 Saturday ========

~/usr/lib/garmin/fit2tcx < ~/dropbox/Garmin/91BA0931.FIT > ~/tmp.tcx

Figured out that Garmin uses the distance field, while Runkeeper ignores
it and re-computes the distance between the 50m waypoints using the
latitudes and longitudes, and assuming you took a straight line between
them.

======== 2019 January 24 Thursday ========

After upgrading to Ubuntu 18.10, can’t adjust the backlight brightness
on my X260 with xbacklight.  Instead:

Wanted Google Earth to start working again on my Thinkpad X260 so apt
uninstalled “xserver-xorg-video-intel” as recommended here:

Rebooted, and it worked!

Which feeds should I bother generating for my blog?  Tallying the most
recent log file:

 /brandon/category/python/feed/index.xml
 /brandon/category/zope/feed/index.xml
 /brandon/feed/
 /brandon/feed/atom/

But the Zope feed had only one fetch, so I’m retiring it anyway.

After several suspends, my Lenovo Thinkpad X260 sometimes suffers
from flickering graphics and even freezes that show up in the kernel
logs as:

So, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T460s and thus
I am adding i915.enable_rc6=0 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in
